# PART I

Remove the content in `<style></style>`, and add `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />` to link the css file created by me.

Change the cover image name to its specific one. For example, `<link rel="coverpage" href="images/<cover image name>" />` and `<img src="images/<cover image name>" style="width: 100%" alt="cover" />`
